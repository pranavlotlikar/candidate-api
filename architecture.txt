Candidate API Architecture & Design

The classes span across 3 main layers:
1. Controller
- Here, all the valid API requests are handled.
- It needs the Dao for all the API operations to take place.
- It returns the data in JSON format.

2. Dao
- This layer does all the major data operations such as: adding a candidate, casting a vote, 
  getting latest count, listing all candidates and fetching the winner.
- It also declares and initializes the temporary data which is a List of Candidates.
- Validation for invalid/empty names is handle over here.

3. Entity
- Contains the Candidate entity which models the data being stored. 
- It contains 2 fields: name and votes
- Although this API does not use a database, this entity object can be mapped to a table


There is also an additional package which groups code to handle Custom Exceptions.
